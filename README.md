#1920-AppliedProgramming

This repository contains two projects I had to complete for my Applied Programming class.
The first project contains a program that can compress color on images and can use dithering to emulate color depth.
The second project leverages 3D object creation in WPF. The project can construct a 3D model from boundaries of countries and reconstruct them in 3D.
The height of the object can be used to visualize data.
Each project contains another .md (respectively Project1.md and Project2.md) with more information about the implementation, in dutch.
I ended up getting a 19/20 on the course and was very happy with the way both projects turned out.
